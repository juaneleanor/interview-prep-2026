    "## Big‑O Time Complexity (Core Concepts)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big‑O notation** measures the speed and efficiency of algorithms and data structures.\n",
    "It quantifies the worst-case scenario in terms of the input size, denoted as n.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Big‑O Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(1) – Constant Time**: Operation time does not change regardless of input size (e.g., accessing the first item in a list).\n",
    "* **O(n) – Linear Time**: Operation time scales directly with the size of the input (e.g., searching through a list).\n",
    "* **O(n²) – Quadratic Time**: Every element interacts with every other element, causing exponential growth in operations (e.g., handshake problem).\n",
    "* **O(log n) – Logarithmic Time**: Search space is halved repeatedly, faster than linear but slower than constant (e.g., dictionary lookup using binary search).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule of thumb:** One pass → O(n). Nested loops → O(n²). Halving repeatedly → O(log n).\n",

    "## Detailed Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arrays** provide extremely fast access by index due to contiguous memory but resizing is costly. When deleting an element, all subsequent elements must shift down to maintain the array's contiguous structure.\n",
    "* **Linked Lists** allow efficient insertion/deletion without shifting elements but have slower access because you have to traverse the list from the beginning.\n",
    "* **Stacks & Queues** are simple, ordered structures optimized for adding/removing elements at one or both ends, with O(1) insertions and deletions.\n",
    "* **Heaps** maintain a priority ordering (min or max), enabling efficient retrieval of the smallest or largest element with logarithmic insert and removal operations. They are balanced binary heaps.\n",
    "* **HashMaps** use hash functions to achieve near constant-time access but can degrade to linear time if many collisions occur; collision resolution strategies include linked-list chaining and linear-probing.\n",
    "* **BSTs** rely on sorted tree structures for efficient searching but performance depends on tree balance. The left child has to contain values smaller than the parent and the right child has to contain values greater than the parent.\n",
    "* **Sets**  ensure uniqueness of elements and are often implemented via hash tables, sharing similar performance traits and collision challenges as hash maps.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different data structures are optimized for different scenarios and operations.\n",
    "* **Big‑O** notation is crucial for understanding and comparing their performance.\n",
    "* Choosing the right data structure can drastically affect the efficiency of algorithms, especially in large-scale applications.\n",
    "* Understanding underlying principles such as memory layout, pointers, and ordering rules is essential for mastering data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BFS** commonly uses **Queues**; **DFS** commonly uses **Stacks**.\n",
    "* Python **dict** is a **HashMap**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Quick Interview Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always state **time & space complexity**.\n",
    "* Explain *why* a structure fits the problem.\n",
    "* Start simple; optimize only if needed.\n"
